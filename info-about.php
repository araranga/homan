         <p>ABOUT HOHMANN FINE ART
         </p>
         <p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:muli; font-size:10.0pt">HOHMANN represents a family endeavor in fine art that spans four decades and two continents. Established in 1976 in Germany, the original Galerie Hohmann started as an exhibition space for local and regional artists at the time and slowly grew into a destination for art collectors from all over Germany. In the late 1990s the American side of the family ventured very successfully into the business when The Hart Gallery opened locations in Carmel, Chicago and Palm Desert. In 2009, after the Harts retired, Hohmann Fine Art opened in Palm Desert, CA.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#333333; font-family:muli; font-size:10.0pt">A walk through the many galleries on El Paseo in Palm Desert ultimately leads to the HOHMANN showroom. After several expansions, the gallery now occupies most of the building and offers 5,000 square feet exhibition space, three galleries and a walk-in storage facility housing more than a thousand works of art on site.</span></p>
         <p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="color:#333333; font-family:muli; font-size:10.0pt">The gallery has published more than 50 catalogs, participated in art fairs in the US and Europe, and hosted almost 40 exhibitions since 2009 and more than 200 since 1976. The Hohmann family has curated a large number of private collections and public exhibitions including museum shows and work with more than 250 national and international artists of whom they represent more than 50 exclusively.&nbsp;</span></p>

         <p>Philanthropy is a central part of the HOHMANN philosophy. The gallery donates art and funds to more than 15 local and national charities every year, hoping to inspire others to do the same.</p>
         <p>While the Hohmann family has no program that prefers one movement or technique over another, the requirements to be showcased in the gallery are extremely high and discerning. Contemporary artists are handpicked and thoroughly vetted before considered for representation. When it comes to secondary market works, only the best quality and impeccable condition are exhibited. The Hohmann Gallery program is as simple as it is diverse: “Originality, quality, consistency and longevity”</p>
         <p>A recent accomplishment was the grant of a trademark on the family name by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, recognizing the family’s contribution to the art world.</p>
