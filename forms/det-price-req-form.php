                              We apologize for the inconvenience of not being able to view prices. It is not by our choice. Many of our artists and vendors don’t allow us to publish prices. We are working with them to ultimately have prices for everything on the web site and until then, you may inquire by e-mail and we will answer as quickly as possible.

                              If you are trying to determine the value of a work you own, or doing research for an appraisal or just trying to get an idea of the general price level of the gallery, please contact us through the general contact form here: 
                              <button type="button" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#info-contact" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs">Contact Us</button>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              We will direct your request to the appropriate person to help you. Much work and research goes into determining the value of a work of art and an appraisal takes into consideration many factors besides the price of a comparable work. Please be respectful with the time of our art consultants.
